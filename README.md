Task where we build a simple TCP server using Python.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install Python (preferably version 3.9 or higher)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/julianmonzon/creando-servidor-tcp.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd creando-servidor-tcp

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv .venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  .venv\Scripts\activate
- On macOS/Linux:
  source .venv/bin/activate

5. Run the TCP server:
